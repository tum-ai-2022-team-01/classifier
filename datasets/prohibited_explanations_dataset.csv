92,"The AI ​​services of an external partner who were trained with an extensive set of real threat data continuously distinguish real threats to harmless objects in real time. They become more intelligent over time when new threat profiles are discovered. In addition, they show the security personnel exactly where weapons on the body or in their pocket could be hidden, and enable the guards to intervene precisely and quickly. The technology uses artificial intelligence and facial recognition software to analyze live recordings of approaching visitors: to analyze inside, to determine whether it is approved persons, such as regular visitors: inside, VIPs, employees: inside and other people who access them should be granted. If a visitor is emphasized as a non -permissible person, his/her profile will be sent to security officers and a human person can check and verify the data. The technology claims to allow at least one person per second.",The AI System deploys ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement.
119,"Hanes Australasia with its headquarters in Melbourne, home of some of the best known clothing and lifestyle brands of Australia- including Bonds, Bras N Things and Sheridan- employs more than 4,000 people and is in all of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Great Britain, the USA, China and Represent Indonesia. After taking over the Pacific Brands at the time in 2016, Hanesbrand's Inc., headquartered in North Carolina, sells Hanes Australasia its products via its network of around 550 shops, its 14 websites and its extensive wholesale network. With its Google Cloud data architecture, which helped Hanes Australasia to achieve a leading position as e-commerce dealer in Australia and beyond, the company began to examine how machine learning could use to offer even more convincing, more personalized customer experiences . In particular, it wanted to get away from a manual, labor -intensive method to recommend visitors: inside his websites. A team member spent half a day a week to update recommendations for thousands of products using complicated spreadsheets.",The AI System takes advantage of (=exploit) the potential vulnerabilities of a specific group to materially distort their behaviour.
121,"There is no unified, numerical credit score for businesses or individuals, rather national and local platforms use different evaluation or rating systems. Due to the differences in various pilot programs and a fragment system structure, information regarding the scoring mechanism is often conflicting.  T he numerical score mechanism was limited to private credit rating and loyalty programs. The national regulatory method has been based on blacklisting and whitelisting, which is triggered by specific offenses instead of a low score number.  The Central Government operates a number of national and regional blacklists based on various types of violations. The court system is available for businesses, organizations, and individuals to appeal their violations. After being put on the blacklist, it typically takes 2–5 years to be removed from the blacklist, but early removal is also possible if the blacklisted person ""fulfills legal obligations or remedies"". Blacklist violations for businesses include not paying tax on time, being unable to maintain necessary licenses, producing low-quality goods, and disobeying environmental protection policies.",General purpose social scoring
122,"The toys are connected to the internet (via WiFi or Bluetooth to a phone or other device with internet access) and send data to the supplier. This enables the company's AI to learn for the company and be better able to talk to the child. The company records and collects all the child’s conversations with the toy, and possibly those with other children and adults who also interact with it. The company records and collects all the child’s conversations with the toy, and possibly those with other children and adults who also interact with it. The company is probably storing this data and certainly using it to create a better product. These toys will be very influential because the children will be conversing with them all the time and can encourage them for harmful actions. It can put children at risk.

123,"The current market of RBI systems is overwhelmingly dominated by image-based products, at the centre of which is facial recognition technology (FRT). Other products such as face detection and person detection technologies are also in use. FRT is typically being deployed to perform two types of searches: cooperative searches for verification and/ or authentication purposes, and non-cooperative searches to identify a data subject. The former involves voluntary consent from the data subject to capture their image, while the latter may not. Live facial recognition is currently the most controversial deployment of FRT: Live video feeds are used to generate snapshots of individuals and then match them against a database of known individuals – the “watchlist”.",Remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces
