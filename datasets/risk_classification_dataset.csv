 KI offers the opportunity to check several CVs much faster and more efficiently. AI models can quickly compare job descriptions to search for several crucial parameters and to check, such as: B. Earlier experiences of the candidate: inside with a certain company, networks within a certain industrial area, social skills and profiles on social media.
 AI technologies use NLP to quickly filter out the appropriate candidate: quickly out and avoid accidental elimination by taking job descriptions into account with different titles that mean the same. NLP can analyze the social media profile and past online activities of candidate: analyze inside to determine key rates or functions that can arouse your interest in a position or job description. This function enables recruiters: Inside, to determine the interaction channels in which the desired candidate are the most active inside, which can continue to help not only get in touch faster, but also to offer the candidate: also a more personal experience inside.

Since its introduction, the solution has recorded over 5 million question calls. The knowledge database has proven to be particularly useful for new employees: inside, the immediate access to all information you need when you start a job and a step-by-step instructions to get your work computer running. This saves the IT department valuable time that it can spend on more urgent problems, and gives the employee: inside also the opportunity to manage their own learning and onboarding-which means that they are brought up to date faster.
 
 AI-based platforms can analyze millions of data points that create office teams every day, and use the results to build a real-time network of the knowledge of an organization. Questions go directly to the people who are suitable to help, which enables high -quality answers and quick reactions. AI-supported knowledge databases that use technologies such as NLP and machine learning can increase the productivity of these systems by recognizing content types, extracting important information and automatically organizing content in common topics such as projects, products, processes and customers. AI platforms also help to collect data from different sources such as intranet, wikis, cloud drives and tools for cooperation in order to keep knowledge banks up to date, relevant and useful.
 Some AI models can also help to discover and record the skills of the staff management system.

111,"The travel platform integrated a AI solution that was able to recognize well-known and unknown advertising protection, especially for the recently entered regions in which the customer's existing identification systems had a low cover. The deep learning and natural-length processing models of the AI ​​system recognized that the email accounts had similar names, although the domains and prefixes were different. Although fraudsters used different IP addresses to disguise their traces on the inside, the unattended machine learning algorithms of the AI ​​system recognized that all IP addresses came from the same IP substances. With the help of a proprietary engine for unattended machine learning, the AI ​​solution accelerated the detection by identifying all accounts and events at the same time analyzed and suspicious clusters of malignant activities-even at the time of account registration.
 The AI ​​solution helped the travel platform to save millions of dollars of losses through fraud, and made it possible for her to start new, large-scale advertising campaigns in certainty that only real customers: inside would be given advantages from the platform and its partners.","[0, 1, 0]"

On the side of the final rate, this would give the team an insight into the course of the demos so that it could be trained and the course could be corrected on a large scale. On the onboarding page, the recorded demos, which the team collected, could be used to accelerate onboarding for new employees: inside. New sales employees: In the inside, in every phase of the sales cycle, a ""highlight role"" would have good calls that you could check at the beginning to quickly take you through the individual steps.

116,"The path to AI-controlled lead qualification began before AI became part of the lead assessment process and went in three different phases:
 1. Business rules. Here Microsoft started before AI was added to the lead qualification. The sales and marketing system contained business rules that provided a relative value that indicates the likelihood that a lead will be converted into a sales option. These rules assign a point value to a customer to create a lead rating structure.
 2. AI supported lead scoring. During this phase, Microsoft KI implemented to improve its lead scoring system. Ki-lead scoring focuses on customer behavior and shows the different types, as a customer interacts with Microsoft, values, which creates a more precise scoring result.
 3. Bot-controlled commitment and detection of intentions to talk. The latest phase included the integration of a AI-Bot and an engine based on machine learning, which examines and manages email communication between the customer and the sales team. Microsoft called the engine ""Bot (and Ki) Enabled Augmented Marketing"" (Beam). Beam focuses on recognizing the intention to conversation in order to determine the likelihood that a customer is willing to buy products or services.","[0, 1, 0]"

Due to the differences in various pilot programs and a fragment system structure, information regarding the scoring mechanism is often conflicting.  T he numerical score mechanism was limited to private credit rating and loyalty programs. The national regulatory method has been based on blacklisting and whitelisting, which is triggered by specific offenses instead of a low score number.  The Central Government operates a number of national and regional blacklists based on various types of violations. The court system is available for businesses, organizations, and individuals to appeal their violations. After being put on the blacklist, it typically takes 2–5 years to be removed from the blacklist, but early removal is also possible if the blacklisted person ""fulfills legal obligations or remedies"". Blacklist violations for businesses include not paying tax on time, being unable to maintain necessary licenses, producing low-quality goods, and disobeying environmental protection policies.","[0, 0, 1]"
